# Fall_TITCo

Fall is known to be the second most common mechanism of injury causing morbidity and mortality through all age groups. 
A fall is defined as 

“an event which results in a person coming to rest inadvertently on the ground or other lower level and other than as a consequence of the following: 
Sustaining a violent blow, as in a stroke, an epileptic seizure” (1). 

Injury due to fall can precipitate into further health loss in the younger population having the risk of lifelong disability 
and in the older population with frailty and comorbidities having prolonged hospitalisation or even mortality. 
Study of fall therefore requires more attention as it in any population can lead to substantial morbidity and mortality, while being preventable. 
We aim to study the profile and injury characteristics of patients who arrived to the EDs of four tertiary care centers with a history of fall.
